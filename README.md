## Changelog

[Github]https://github.com/Cabuxito/Bibliotek.Opgave/branches - Here is my branches and what it happens in every update.

**v0.1**:
I have make the basic structure for the program , like the variables I needed and the base from user interactions.

**v0.2**:
After all the basics was in place, I did create a new class Laaner and some methods to create a new laaner or get laaner.

**v0.3**
In this version I did change all the collections to List<>, because the program works more fluid.

**v0.4**
After the basics works, I needed a Menu or user interface so, I did create a menu and do it interactive.

**v0.5**
Version 5 was the last version where I use some inheritance, and create a Person Classe.

**v0.6**
I choose to add some features to the program, so I did some user implements so the program works better, and now can find a user by "ID".

**v0.7**
Now its possible delete one user by id.
